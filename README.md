# Assignment 1 – Definitions Sorting

## Overview

This project focuses on organizing and sorting textbook definitions related to algorithms and data structures. The aim is to create a clean, structured, and readable dataset that can be processed programmatically and used for further analysis or study.

The work is done as part of **COMP 359 – Assignment 1 (Topic 14)** and emphasizes practical skills such as data cleaning, basic algorithmic thinking, and collaboration.

## Project Structure

* **data/**
  Contains the cleaned dataset of extracted textbook definitions provided and edited for this assignment.

* **python_impl/**
  Contains Python scripts used to load, clean, and sort the definitions.

* **analysis.md**
  Notes and observations related to the dataset and approach.

* **README.md**
  Project overview and documentation.

## What the Program Does

* Loads definitions from a text-based dataset.
* Cleans unnecessary empty lines or formatting issues.
* Separates definitions based on given criteria (e.g., memorized vs non-memorized).
* Sorts the definitions and outputs a final structured list.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Git and GitHub for version control

## Collaboration

This project was completed as a group effort:

* **Japneet Kaur** – Python implementation, data handling, and documentation.
* **Jang Toor** – Test examples, validation of sorted output, and review.

## Notes

* The provided textbook definitions collection is treated as the ground truth.
* Minor edits were made only where necessary (e.g., removing section headers).
* The focus was on clarity and correctness rather than perfection.
